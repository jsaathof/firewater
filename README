firewater is a(nother) host-based firewall configuration tool.
It offers a simple way to compose firewall policies from the command prompt,
without the need for a GUI.

firewater lowers the steep learning curve that native firewalling commands
have. firewater features user-definable logical groups to keep your policies
(or rules) readable and easy to understand.
For maximum flexibility, typical firewater statements may be intermixed
with native commands to the underlying system-specific firewall.

> This is firewater version 1 for Linux iptables.
> There exists a firewater version 2 with nicer syntax and that supports
> both iptables and nftables:
